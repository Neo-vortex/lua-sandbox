# Lua Repository

This repository contains the Lua programming language, an embeddable scripting language with a focus on simplicity and extensibility. Lua is commonly used as a lightweight scripting language in various domains, including game development, embedded systems, and scripting within larger applications.

## Features

- **Simplicity**: Lua is designed to be simple, lightweight, and easy to learn. Its clean and intuitive syntax allows developers to quickly write and understand Lua code.

- **Embeddable**: Lua is designed to be embedded within larger applications, providing a powerful scripting language that can be seamlessly integrated into existing systems.

- **Extensibility**: Lua provides mechanisms for extending its functionality with C/C++ code, allowing developers to create custom libraries and modules to enhance Lua's capabilities.

## Library Fusion System

In this repository, we have implemented a Library Fusion System, which allows you to selectively load specific Lua libraries based on a fusion value. The `luaL_openlibs` function has been modified to support this feature. Here's an example usage:

```c
#include "lua.h"
#include "lauxlib.h"

LUALIB_API void luaL_openlibs(lua_State* L, int fuse) {
  // Base library
  if (fuse == 0 || fuse % 2 == 1) {
    luaL_requiref(L, LUA_GNAME, luaopen_base, 1);
    lua_pop(L, 1);
  }

  // Package library
  if (fuse % 3 == 0) {
    luaL_requiref(L, LUA_LOADLIBNAME, luaopen_package, 1);
    lua_pop(L, 1);
  }

  // ... (other libraries)

  // Debug library
  if (fuse % 29 == 0) {
    luaL_requiref(L, LUA_DBLIBNAME, luaopen_debug, 1);
    lua_pop(L, 1);
  }
}
In this system, the fuse value determines which libraries are loaded. Each library is associated with a prime number, and if the fuse value is divisible by that prime number, the corresponding library is loaded.

Examples
Here are a few examples of how you can use the Library Fusion System:

To load only the Base library:
```c
luaL_openlibs(L, 1);
```

To load both the Base and String libraries:
```c
luaL_openlibs(L, 3);
```
